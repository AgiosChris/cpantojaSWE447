1. An overview of your project, summarized in a short paragraph.  For example, if you're idea for
your final project was to draw a solar system (which we've already done in class, so you can't 
use this example â€” be creative!)
    
    For my final project, my ideal project would be having an atom with the electrons moving around the protons.
    For a new shape, I would implement a cylindar or a rectangle glass to have the atom inside of it.
    
2. A sequence of steps for implementing your project.  You have five weeks for completing the 
project (presentations will be done in class on May 1st),  (that does not include this coming 
week, which is for writing this proposal) so breakdown your project into five chunks.
    
    Week 1; Get code from solarsystem.js to have circles float around the nucleus
    Week 2; Get a few protons and neurons to stay in the center while electrons move around them
    Week 3; Scale down the circles and position the protons, change their colors
    Week 4; Add light to show the circles as spheres.
    Week 5; Learn how to make a seethrough glass cylindar and have the atom in the moddle
    
3. How you're intending to implement your application.

    I will be using Three.js.
